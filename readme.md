# Robust revenue-maximization auction experiments in Python
codes related to my thesis about experimenting with robust auctions.

The scripts start with APX_DAPX are auction experiments for single-item and single-bidder case. Others are for multiplt i.i.d. items case.
Folder multitem_result stores the results from multi-item experiments.

Feel free to use my auction-experiment implementation for your own interest.
